          I'm joking! I'm Bryan, a
          <b class="bold">Junior UX designer </b>based in
          <b class="bold">Italy</b> üçï, ever since I was a kid, I have always
          loved <b class="bold">IT</b> and <b class="bold">design</b>.

          <br />
          I think that in IT there is always a <b class="bold">solution</b> and
          I live my life like that, there is a problem? so
          <b class="bold">analyze</b> it, go to stakoverflow and... Oh NONO i
          resolve it, there is inherent <b class="bold">problem-solving</b> in
          my being. My Educational? is a bit <b class="bold">Strange</b>, since
          9 years old i tryed to make something with my first
          <b class="bold">Computer</b>, my dream was to become a "IT
          technician".The dream was interrupted from the choise of the school
          because i decided to make Accounting, a choise took a bit for i my
          analysis and problem solving skills a bit for my parents suggestion,
          After 5 years (6 to be honest ) graduation in accounting i started to
          work in turism field as receptionist. After 2 years i was a Hotel
          Receptionist, accountant and IT helper while i trying to make
          Economics as University. During the Covid-19 pandemic i discover that
          the life i was living wasn't mine and furthermore was what i hated
          during my teen ages, a static work in a satureted field and a
          "old"work. So i decided that i didn't wanna be the old boy with a old
          work and a static life. and surfing in the net i discover an
          impressive amount of new and innovative works. And a day i found
          start2impact a

            target="_blank"
          >
            online course
          </a>

          that help you to reach a professional profile in the field you choose.
          And i choose Ux design, and since that moment i loved that amazing
          "new" World, A world that fit my being since i was Joung. And yes i
          finally find my dream Job.
